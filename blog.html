        <h2>Introduction to Web Development Video</h2>
        <p>Kerry Spencer / July 18th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            The video below is a tutorial for learning web development for people who are beginners. It is a great introductory video and it covers a variety
            of tools that are used for web development.

        <h2>My View on Cryptography</h2>
        <p>Kerry Spencer / July 14th, 2022</p>

        <p>
            I think that I have been impacted by cryptography in a major way because without it, we would not have been able to learn about civilizations
            of the past. Being able to learn about these societies has allowed people to further their education of history and ancient times. I think that
            whether cryptography is positive or negative depends on the context in which it is used. Cryptography can be a very helpful tool, whether it is
            used for good or bad purposes. When cryptography is used during wartimes to warn troops of an enemy attack, that would be seen as a positive use.
            If the information that being hidden by cryptography is dangerous, then that would be seen as a negative use.
