        <h1>Kerry Spencer's Biography</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Kerry Spencer and I am a sophomore at <strong>Syracuse University</strong> majoring in Information Management & Technology.
            I am from Westchester, NY but I live in Nashville, TN.
        </p>

            I decided to become a TA for this class because of how much I enjoyed my experience with IT Girls. I participated in
            the retreat in the Fall of 2019, and it was such an incredible experience. It is one of the main reasons as to why I
            chose to attend Syracuse University, and it helped me further my interest in IT.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to specific interests in technology, I am very interested in data analytics. Data is very important in
            many different career fields, such as sports, healthcare, and retail. I am very fascinated by the idea of using data
            to make the world a better place.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love spending time with friends, going to games in the Dome, and listening to music. I love watching TV, and my
            favorite shows are Stranger Things and Criminal Minds.
        </p>
